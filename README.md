# posit-conf2023-talk

Hello! 

Here is my slide deck for my talk ["Field Guide to Writing Your First R package"] at [posit::conf(2023)](https://posit.co/conference/)

Doodles in the slides are my own, I am happy to share these if anyone finds these useful!
I will figure out a way to get these on GitHub or a website so they are easy to download :)
